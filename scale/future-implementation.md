### Future Implementation and Scaling Roadmap

This document outlines possible future enhancements for the wah4pc-validation-server to support broader interoperability needs, higher reliability, and production-grade scale.

---

#### 1) Business Rule Validation (beyond FHIR/PHCore)
- Add a business rules engine to validate real-world healthcare logic (age checks, clinical appropriateness, workflow constraints)
- Philippine-specific policies (PhilHealth, DOH facility rules, PSGC verification)
- Cross-resource and cross-encounter consistency checks

#### 2) Performance and Scale
- Horizontal scaling with multiple API replicas behind a reverse proxy/load balancer
- Caching of conformance and terminology lookups (in-memory + distributed cache)
- Asynchronous validation queue for batch submissions (message broker)
- Streaming and chunked processing for large Bundles

#### 3) Observability and Reliability
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Metrics (latency, throughput, error rates) with dashboards
- Distributed tracing across services
- Health checks, readiness/liveness probes

#### 4) Security and Governance
- API keys / OAuth 2.0 / mTLS depending on deployment context
- Request quotas/rate limiting and abuse protection
- Audit trails for all validations with tamper-evident storage
- Data retention and redaction/anonymization options

#### 5) Deployment and Environments
- Containerization and Helm charts for Kubernetes
- Blue/Green or Canary deployments with rollbacks
- Environment promotion flows (dev → test → staging → prod)

#### 6) Extensibility
- Pluggable rule modules per resource type
- External terminology resolvers (remote terminology servers)
- Configurable validation pipelines per client/tenant

#### 7) Developer Experience
- OpenAPI documentation enhancements and examples
- Sandbox mode with synthetic datasets
- SDKs/clients in multiple languages (optional)

#### 8) Data and Policy Updates
- Scheduled ingestion and versioning of PHCore/HL7 artifacts
- Validation behavior pinning by artifact version
- Change logs and compatibility notes for client integrators

This roadmap is intentionally high-level to guide phased delivery while keeping implementation flexible for evolving national policies and healthcare partner requirements.
